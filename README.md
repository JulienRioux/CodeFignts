Here is my solutions for the boxBlur problem in Python3

The goal is to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.

Exemples:

For:

image = [[7, 4, 0, 1], 
         [5, 6, 2, 2], 
         [6, 10, 7, 8], 
         [1, 4, 2, 0]]
         
         
The output should be

boxBlur(image) = [[5, 4], 
                  [4, 4]]
